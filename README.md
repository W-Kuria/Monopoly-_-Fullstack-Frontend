# 🎲 Monopoly Fullstack Frontend

This is the **frontend** for the Monopoly Fullstack project — an interactive digital remake of the classic Monopoly board game.  
It provides the user interface that connects with the Flask backend, allowing players to roll dice, move around the board, buy properties, pay rent, draw Chance/Community Chest cards, and manage game states in real-time.

---

##  Overview

The Monopoly frontend is built using **React** and **Vite**, delivering a fast, dynamic, and responsive UI. It integrates with the backend via RESTful APIs to handle all game logic, player management, and property transactions.  

The goal is to recreate the Monopoly experience digitally while maintaining the rules and flow of the traditional board game.
